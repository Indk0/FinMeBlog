## Project Overview
### Key goals
#### The key goal for this project is to create a functioning personal finance blog for readers who want to increase their personal finance knowledge. Readers will be able to select from a variety of blog which explore topics from investing to budgeting. The blog will also have a carousel of stocks on the home and blog pages, this however will be a could have feature.
### Target audience
#### My target audience are people who are interested in personal finance aged between 18-35, my target audience could be as young as 16. My target audience will also be very aware of how important financial health is for themselves.
### User Requirements
#### Must Have:
### Inspiration
#### The inspiration from for this blog comes from a similiar site called Yahoo Finance, I have used Yahoo Finance in the past to read on news regarding the economy and the financial health of American technology companies. The key difference is that FinMe will be tailored more towards to personal finance instead of the American stock market. 

#### Yahoo Finance is more geared towards readers who have an advanced knowledge in topics such as the economy and the American stock market, FinMe will be aimed at readers who are at the beginning stages of their personal financial journey to advanced readers who might want to use FinMe as an analysis platform to gauge on consumer interest.

## Planning

## Project Management
### Agile Methodologies
#### I decided to use many different agile methodologies to set and complete goals, to set goals I used user epics and stories. I am also going to use utilise kanban boards to help me track my progress, there will be 6 kanban boards, 5 of which are sprints, the Financial Blog kanban has the user epics whilst the rest of the boards have user stories which are made from two different types of stories.
### User Epics

### User Story
#### There are two types of user story template I have created: a user and a developer template, the user template is created with the statement and acceptance criteria from the user perspective on the other hand, the developer template is created to help myself track goals through the statement and acceptance criteria. Most sprint kanban boards will have the developer template however, the user template can be added.
### MoSCoW
#### MoSCoW is used for the user stories, these are the labels used: Must Have, Could Have, Should Have and Future Consideration. Instead of using the "Won't Have" label, I will aim to create user stories based on features I could add to my blog in the future by using the label "Future Consideration". 
### Sprints
#### I have broken down my project into 5 different sprints, for each sprint will have a dedicated label to help mark a user story:
* Sprint 1: Initial Setup - The goal for this sprint is to complete the foundational set up for to allow for the project to tkae shape, this includes planning the wireframes, creating the readme file, downloading all the packages, creating the folders and files.  
* Sprint 2: Data - This sprint is dedicated to creating the models for the blog functionality this includes creating and refining the ERD diagram.
* Sprint 3: Admin - 
* Sprint 4: Templates and Auth -
* Sprint 5: Functionality and Cloudinary -
