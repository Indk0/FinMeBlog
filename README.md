## Project Overview
### Key goals
#### The key goal for this project is to create a functioning personal finance blog for readers who want to increase their personal finance knowledge. Readers will be able to select from a variety of blog which explore topics from investing to budgeting. The blog will also have a carousel of stocks on the home and blog pages, this however will be a could have feature.
### Target audience
#### My target audience are people who are interested in personal finance aged between 18-35, my target audience could be as young as 16. My target audience will also be very aware of how important financial health is for themselves.
### User Requirements -  The projects have all of the in-depth issues. These are the basic user requirements:
#### Must Have: User Should be able to access the site and read the many blogs available.
#### Should Have: Should blogs may contain guides and tips to help readers take actionable steps on their personal finances.
#### Could Have: Readers can also create accounts from which they can post blogs and comment
### Future consideration are listed at the bottom of this ReadMe file.
### Inspiration
#### The inspiration from for this blog comes from a similiar site called Yahoo Finance, I have used Yahoo Finance in the past to read on news regarding the economy and the financial health of American technology companies. The key difference is that FinMe will be tailored more towards to personal finance instead of the American stock market. 

#### Yahoo Finance is more geared towards readers who have an advanced knowledge in topics such as the economy and the American stock market, FinMe will be aimed at readers who are at the beginning stages of their personal financial journey to advanced readers who might want to use FinMe as an analysis platform to gauge on consumer interest.

## Planning
### Wireframes
#### Here are my wireframes for this project, the mobile and desktop version are in one document for each wireframe.
- [Wireframe for Home Page](./readmemedia/wireframes/HomePage.pdf)
- [Wireframe for Blog Page](./readmemedia/wireframes/BlogPage.pdf)
- [Wireframe for Blog Page Footer](./readmemedia/wireframes/BlogPageFooter.pdf)
### ERD Diagrams
#### The ERD Diagram was made using a tool called Lucidchart.
[ERD Diagram](./readmemedia/ERD/FinMe%20ERD.pdf)
#### A change was made to the database

### Security
## Project Management
### Agile Methodologies
#### I decided to use many different agile methodologies to set and complete goals, to set goals I used user epics and stories. I am also going to use utilise kanban boards to help me track my progress, there will be 6 kanban boards, 5 of which are sprints, the Financial Blog kanban has the user epics whilst the rest of the boards have user stories which are made from two different types of stories.
### User Epics
#### The user epics are stored in the Financial Blog kanban board.
- [Financial Blog kanban board screenshot at the time of building the project.](./readmemedia/screenshots/Userepickanban.png)
### User Story
#### There are two types of user story template I have created: a user and a developer template, the user template is created with the statement and acceptance criteria from the user perspective on the other hand, the developer template is created to help myself track goals through the statement and acceptance criteria. Most sprint kanban boards will have the developer template however, the user template can be added. Below is an example of a user story on a kanban board, please click on the user story title to see the acceptance criteria and the user story statement.

### MoSCoW
#### MoSCoW is used for the user stories, these are the labels used: Must Have, Could Have, Should Have and Future Consideration. Instead of using the "Won't Have" label, I will aim to create user stories based on features I could add to my blog in the future by using the label "Future Consideration". 
### Sprints
#### I have broken down my project into 5 different sprints, for each sprint will have a dedicated label to help mark a user story:
* Sprint 1: Initial Setup - The goal for this sprint is to complete the foundational set up for to allow for the project to tkae shape, this includes planning the wireframes, creating the readme file, downloading all the packages, creating the folders and files.  
* Sprint 2: Data - This sprint is dedicated to creating the models for the blog functionality this includes creating and refining the ERD diagram.
* Sprint 3: Admin - At this stage my goal will be to improve the admin panel UX and add fixture data to test my blog.
* Sprint 4: Templates and Functionality - This is the stage where html and css templates will be created for the various pages my blog will host, the functionality code will be a mixture of could and should have user stories. these codes will make the blog better in terms of UX. 
* Sprint 5: Auth and Cloudinary - This is the final stage of my MVP, at this stage I will create a signup page using the package AllAuth and connect Cloudinary for image upload.
* Sprint 6: Blog Styling/Extras- This final stage will involve me focusing on styling the site this includes: making my site look like the wireframe, add branding, colours, favicon and other features that will make my blog unique. At this stage there will be more could have and future considerations depending on how much time I have left until submission.

## MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
### I complete my MVP with the minimal amount of user/developer stories closed. My MVP, as seen in the image below, shows all of the acceptance criteria ticked, the MVP allows users to read and comment on any blog once registered and logged in. In this case the admin has majority of the features accessable as the admin can create and edit blogs, categories, comments, manipulate user and accounts all from the admin panel. 

![MVP Developer Story](./readmemedia/screenshots/MVPdeveloperstory.png) 

### The MVP blog site has some downsides if used as a product, users will not be able to create blogs as authors this is due to the lack of an account functionality where the author (user) can track the blogs and comments posted in the site. Another downside for the MVP is there's no image upload feature for the author and tha admin, this will significantly impact the user experience as images can help to set the tone for the blog.

## Design
### Colour Palletes
#### Since my inspiration for this project is Yahoo Finance, I decided to follow a similar pathway when it came to adding colours to my blog, Yahoo Finance at most has 5 colours being used on the site, this could be done for a better readability for the users which will contribute to positive UX. Therefore I used as minimal colours as possible for my site:
![Colour Pallet 1](./readmemedia/screenshots/Colour%20pallete%201.png)
![Colour Pallet 2](./readmemedia/screenshots/Colour%20pallete%202.png)
#### Above are the two colour pallete I chose to implement for my site, out of the colours above the two pallates used were:

#### #40916C - I chose this shade of green as this colour is the most associated with money, this colour is used for the branding colour, favicon and the thin border that is present on every blog card on the main page.
#### #003566 - This colour was used for the title background on the blog pages, this colour was chosen as random as the default grey colour looked slightly out of place.
#### #F9FAFC - This is the default background colour that is on across all sites, this colour is pleasent to the eye if users don't spend too much time reading blogs.

### Accounts section colours
#### These were the other colours used for the styling of the accounts page:
#### #007bff - This blue colour is used for all of the edit, save changes, create blog and category buttons.
#### #E74C3C - This colour is used for the delete button, delete buttons on many sites are red to sign a warning to the user.
#### #198754 - This is the only button colour that stands out from the rest as it's green, used for the publish button.
#### #dc3545, #008000, #0056b3 - These colours are used for the messages that are displayed to the user, the red and the green is used to for feedback to the user and the blue colour is used to highlight the blog titles as they are hyperlinked.
#### #155724, #d4edda - These colours are used for the messages that is displayed when the user either edits, deletes, sign in/out, registers, creates or published a blog or a category. These colours have no correlation between the main aspect of the branding, as it's primarily used to get the attention of the user after they completed an action.
#### #188181 - This colour is used for the register, sign in and sign out button.
#### #6c757d - Finally this is the colour used for the cancel button.

### Font
#### The site had default fonts of Robot and Lato, which are taken from Google Fonts.
### Favicon
#### To get the favicon for my site, I used the site:
[Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/)

#### The design of the favicon is simple, it is the first initial of the website name coloured in #40916C with a white background to make it stand out. The font of the favicon is Hind which closely matches the website font.
